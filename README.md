Iâ€™m @nsaltamachia, but please call me Nick!

I'm moving into software engineering from 12 years in media production. I do still love crafting and telling a good story, but I felt the call to become involved in the tech world and I want to focus on becoming a positive contributor here, as well. So, Hello World!

I'm very new to this world and am ALWAYS on the lookout for new friends and, hopefully, perhaps some mentorship as well. 

When I'm not plugged-in, I'm a great big fan of anything sci-fi/fanasty, automotive, health & fitness, and I'm genuinely interested in learning what others are interested in, themselves!
